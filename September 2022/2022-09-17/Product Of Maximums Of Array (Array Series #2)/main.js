Codewars, 7k: Product Of Maximums Of Array (Array Series #2)

Task
Given an array/list [] of integers , Find the product of the k maximal numbers.

Notes
Array/list size is at least 3 .

Array/list's numbers Will be mixture of positives , negatives and zeros

Repetition of numbers in the array/list could occur.

Input >> Output Examples
maxProduct ({4, 3, 5}, 2) ==>  return (20)
Explanation:
Since the size (k) equal 2 , then the subsequence of size 2 whose gives product of maxima is 5 * 4 = 20 .
maxProduct ({8, 10 , 9, 7}, 3) ==>  return (720)
Explanation:
Since the size (k) equal 3 , then the subsequence of size 3 whose gives product of maxima is  8 * 9 * 10 = 720 .

*/

const maxProduct = (num, size) => [...num].sort((a, b) => b - a).slice(0, size).reduce((a, b) => a * b, 1);

console.log(maxProduct([4, 3, 5], 2))
